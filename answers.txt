(a) 8 commits.
(b) January 24th, 2017.
(c) git log is used to see all the changes leading up to the current branch, git status is for seeing everything changed before the most recent commit.
(d) An untracked file is being newly introduced to an index at this commit, while an unstaged file is a file that has some version in the index, but is missing changes from the version in the index.
(e) git reset undoes commits or staging to correct mistakes, while git checkout changes the currently accessed branch (or creates a branch and changes to it if you use the suffix: -b <branch name>).
(f) It de-indexes the uncommitted changes as they are "replaced" by the pulled files.  They are technically still accessable, just not without effort, since it is not indexed anymore in git.
